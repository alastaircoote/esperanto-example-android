# Experanto Example: Android

This is a really simple example of using [Esperanto](https://github.com/alastaircoote/esperanto) on Android. It's designed to do more or less the same thing as the [iOS demo](https://github.com/alastaircoote/esperanto-example-ios) to showcase how we can use JS cross-platform.

But right now it barely does anything. This is mostly proof that cross compilation for Android, iOS and all their various architectures actually works.

## How do I use it?

There is a `.aar` file in the `lib` directory that contains a prebuilt version of Esperanto, so you shouldn't need to do any extra-special setup, just clone and run.
